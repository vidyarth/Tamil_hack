# Tamil hackathon project - Poompugaar

The main motive of our project is to facilitate shopping in local stores and make shop owners sell their products easily. First, the customer should scan the QR code of the particular shop (usually pasted on the entrance of the shop) through our website which will redirect to the corresponding shop portal. Now the customer can view all the products being offered by the shop and their respective available quantities in a sorted manner. Now the customer can order the products and the same will be notified to the shopkeeper. The customer can make payment through our website and the receipt will be generated, followed by which the shopkeeper notifies the customer through mail that he/she can come to the shop and collect the items. In the shopkeeper portal, the shopkeeper can add, update and delete items in the shop. In the customer portal, the customer can view his/her past order details and the receipts. The same goes with the shopkeeper, where the shopkeeper can view the entire payment details of the shop. Hence by our portal, the shopkeepers can avoid long queues before their shop, and the customer also can view the quantities of the products without standing in the line.
